ðŸ“± Environment-Based Login Android App
This is a fun Android mini-game where users must satisfy real device conditions to log in:

Connect to Wi-Fi and match a dynamic "magic word" (Wi-Fi name + battery %).

Adjust screen brightness above a threshold.

Solve a volume button press pattern.

Cover the proximity sensor for 3 seconds.

Take a photo using the device camera.

Once all conditions are met, the Login button unlocks and transitions to a "Logged In" screen!
Built fully in Kotlin using ViewBinding, Permissions API, and SensorManager.
